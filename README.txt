Repository for selected CodeEval solutions.

Please attempt the problems yourself.  You will get the most value
from CodeEval and similar sites by only looking at others' solutions
when you have finished a problem, or if you get really stuck.

note: The above paragraph was written by your mother, who has temporarily
hijacked Donald's GitHub acct 8-).

CodeEval has a forum for general discussion, and most questions should be directed there.
If you have specific points about my solutions you wish to bring up, you may message/email
me through GitHub.  I can't promise to respond, but I will try to do so as time permits.
